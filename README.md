Basically, why I can't finish it by myself is because
> 1. I limited myself into build multiple dictionaries, like {"b": {"e": {"a":{}}}, which is not useful. Li san finished this problem by using class to add many attributes to it like relationships/ id/ labels. Beginning and getting familiar with using function and class is what I need.
> 2. Other than using class,fucntion is also useful to find a node by its ID. These are two main things I learned from this code.
